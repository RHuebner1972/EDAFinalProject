### plot1.R

Question 1:
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all 
sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

### Algorithm:

1. Read data into R from .RDS files.
2. Load ggplot2 library
3. Create the totals from using aggregate function for emissions
4. Create the plot using barpot from the base plotting system


### plot2.R

Question 2
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
